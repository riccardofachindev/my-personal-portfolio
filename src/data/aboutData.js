    title: "About me",
    description1: "Back in 2014, I decided to transform my passion for technology into my job and tumbled into the challenging yet beautiful world of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for a consultancy firm, an insurance corporation, a technology giant, and various start-ups.",
    description2: "My main focus these days is building event-driven user interfaces for our customers at Datamars, a livestock firm. I enjoy the most building software that hits the sweet spot between design and engineering — stuff that looks awesome and works well behind the scenes.",
    description3: "When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually immersing myself in nature, whether by hiking to the top of a mountain or snorkeling to discover the depth of the seas. Travelling with my wife (and our cat!) is one of my greatest joys, and I also enjoy slowing down by doing some yoga or watching a musical with my friends.",
